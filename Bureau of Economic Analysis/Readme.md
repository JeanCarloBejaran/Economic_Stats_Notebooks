## 📈 Personal Consumption Expenditures

### 📓 `Personal_Consumption_Expenditures.ipynb`

#### Overview

This notebook focuses on processing and analyzing **Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)** data. It demonstrates a full workflow from importing raw economic datasets to generating insights about consumption trends.

#### Key Skills and Technologies

- **🐍 Python & Jupyter Notebooks**
  - Demonstrates code organization and narrative documentation in a notebook format.
- **📊 Data Wrangling with Pandas**
  - Includes reading CSV files (or similar), cleaning irregular fields, and merging data sources.
- **🔍 Exploratory Analysis**
  - Uses descriptive statistics and simple tests to identify outliers or unexpected values.
- **✅ Data Validation & Testing**
  - Employs small checks to confirm data integrity (e.g., verifying row counts and ensuring no nulls in critical fields).
- **📂 Version Control & Documentation**
  - Code is structured with clear comments; indicates best practices for Git or related systems.

## 📉 GDP by Metropolitan and State Area

### 📓 `GDP_by_Metropolitan_State_Area.ipynb`

#### Overview

Analyzes **GDP** data broken down by specific metropolitan and state areas. Showcases techniques for combining multiple datasets into a consistent framework suitable for location-based economics analysis.

#### Key Skills and Technologies

- **🐍 Python & Jupyter Notebooks**
  - Facilitates step-by-step processing and commentary on data transformation.
- **🔗 Advanced Pandas Operations**
  - Demonstrates table joins, grouping by geographic regions, and pivoting data for comparative insights.
- **🧹 Data Cleaning & Normalization**
  - Converts raw inputs into well-structured formats, ensuring uniform column types and naming schemes.
- **🛡️ Testing & Error Handling**
  - Implements checks to catch incorrect values and handle edge cases (e.g., missing or malformed location codes).
- **📈 Analytical Coding Techniques**
  - Illustrates how to surface trends (e.g., biggest contributors to GDP) and leverages code efficiency (vectorized operations, minimal loops).
